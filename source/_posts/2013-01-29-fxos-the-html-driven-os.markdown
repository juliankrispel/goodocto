I've always been a little unhappy with WebApps. Never as slick as native Apps, they are beefed up websites, second class citizens in the App world. Always less performant, hardly usable offline and only using a fraction of device-features. 

With their new project: Firefox OS, Mozilla are about to change that. Purely driven by HTML CSS and Javascript, Firefox OS pushes for a future in which there is no noticable difference between web and native apps.

## Changing the Status Quo

Firefox OS is in many ways a vehicle for drafting, implementing and testing Mozillas [extensive list of experimental WebAPIs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI#APIs), to show them in action and hopefully push them as Standards, so they become available not only on phones but on desktops and laptops alike.

The sort of APIs we are talking about are mindblowingly close to the metal. Imagine being able to interface via Javascript with your phones alarm, camera, vibration-features, bluetooth, contacts, SMS, payments, settings or calendar.

Potentially we are talking about Applications that can not only live on the web but on any device inside or outside a browser.

This opens up a context for Javascript that makes us rethink what 'WebApps' actually are and if we can still call them that, since they will not anymore be confined to the web.

## A truly open platform

If you, like me, ever wanted to do a mobile app, you might have tried making an iOS app with Objective C and Xcode, only to be frustrated by a steep learning curve and a clunky process.

You might have also tried Titanium or PhoneGap, only to realise that performance and API access are too far behind the platforms that they are built on top of.

This OS embodies a future where even low-level code is written with HTML CSS and Javascript, semantic, human readable, truly open and thus accessible to as many people as possible.

## The good guys

2 weeks ago, at my favourite meetup (the [async](http://asyncjs.com/) in brighton) I saw James Hugmans presentation about Firefox OS. He told us a lot of the above and also that he works on implementing Mozillas WebAPIs on a fork of Android. My impression of this project was that the guys from Mozilla seem to be nothing but dedicated to push the Web forward, to make technology more accessible for users and developers alike.

My personal theory is that Mozilla won't impede their innovation-cycle with a profit-making agenda because they have none, much unlike their for-profit counterparts. Rather than working for a business-model, they work for ideas, and bloody good ones too!
