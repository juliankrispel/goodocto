I think the reason I like the former incarnation is because it would read like a sentence to almost anyone, even those unfamiliar with Ruby (like my mom and we all know it is important for moms to be able to read code).

The if version just feels easier to process than the version with unless. I think using unless with else is like speaking with double negatives. It slows down the next programmer in the code, as they have to think instead of just flowing through the conditional, if that makes sense.

unless foo.nil? and if foo equate to the same thing but is kind of a double negative issue, like I just mentioned about using unless with else. Thanks for the another bad unless tip Ryan!

{% blockquote Pythagoras, %}
  The oldest, shortest words - "yes" and "no" - are those which require the most thought.
{% endblockquote %}

``` javascript This is a pretty neat thing
alert('Hello there Motherblother');

console.log('dwq')

if(hab == true)
  dothis();
else
  dothat();
```
The reason I hate (and it is hate, not just dislike as above) unless with multiple conditions is that I always forget whether the “not” applies to only the first conditional or to all of them. If you are wondering, the “not” does apply to all conditionals, but just talking about it has me feeling confused again, so please do not do this…
