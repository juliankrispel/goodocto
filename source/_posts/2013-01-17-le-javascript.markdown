Although I accidentally (almost) broke into somebodies flat and had a few other little disasters/adventures, I enjoyed Paris and I'm glad I came to DotJS (A Javascript Conference at the end of 2012), in hindsight.


I've made a few 1-minute sketches of most of the speakers accompanied with notes.

<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/matthias_bynens.jpg 'Mathias Bynens' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Mathias Bynens</strong> kicked off the conference with Javascripts relationship to unicode. He managed to make a cracker out of what could have been the longest 20 minutes of my life.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/kevin_schaaf.jpg 'Kevin Schaaf' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Kevin Schaaf</strong> talked about the <a href="enyojs.com" title="Enyo Web Application Framework">Enyo</a> Web Application Framework. As far as I'm aware it had been developed in connection with the open-sourced <a href="http://www.openwebosproject.org/" title="Web Os">WebOs</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/addy_osmani.jpg 'Addy Osmani' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Addy Osmani</strong> showed us some Chrome tricks like debugging Sass in Chrome wtf?  A quarter of the way through Addy's talk his time ran out. Which meant he couldn't talk about Yeoman. Damnit Addy! 
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
     
<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/bert_belder.jpg 'Bert Belder' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Bert Belder</strong> about node.js and his experience of working as part of the node core team. He had an interesting face! 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/charlie_robbins.jpg 'Charlie Robbins' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Charlie Robbins</strong> talked basically about managing a team of developers, that's what his job is, as a cofounder of nodejitsu. He seems like the perfect boss, seriously.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/brian_leroux.jpg 'Brian Leroux' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Brian Leroux</strong> gave a hilarious presentation about Javascript's irregularities. The crowd was roaring. I laughed so hard I kept dropping my pencil. He hosts <a href="http://wtfjs.com">wtfjs</a>, a collection of all that codehumor.
    </p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/vojta_jina.jpg 'Vojta Jina' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Vojta Jina</strong> didn't talk about Angular (I have such an itch to use it), but he gave an inspirational talk about the stories behind his idols. The most passionate, heartfelt talk I heard all day.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/jacob_thornton.jpg 'Jacob Thornton' %}
    <p>
      <strong>Jacob Thornton</strong> a.k.a fat told the great history of le Open Source.  Later on I read his blog and <a href="http://byfat.xxx/burn-your-idols" title="Burn your idols">somewhere it said that he drew his idols once</a>. He must think I'm stalking him or something.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p third left">  
    {% img m-b-s /images/dotjs/axel_rauschmayer.jpg 'Axel Rauschmayer' %}
    <p>
      As his blog is one of the few I actually read I was pleasantly surprised to see <strong>Axel Rauschmayer</strong> on stage. We later went for a meal and a drink with <a href="http://twitter.com/netzzwerg">Bela Varga</a>, founder of the munich Javascript. I actually wish I could see more of these two, had a really good time talking to them.

One person I didn't draw is <strong>Mr Doob</strong>, because he was always hidden by the bloody laptop. Nevertheless, that man's a genuius! He showed some incredible Demo-scene Wysiwyg thing. I'm not sure what exactly it does, but I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Then there's of course the other Lightning speakers as well as Christian Amor Kvalheim who talked about the challenges of HTML5 game development. He even made a pacman multiplayer where node deals with the concurrency. It didn't work unfortunately, I blame the dodgy wifi!

Paris is beautiful. The food at the conference and everywhere else was amazing. But I have to say I did see about 2 or three families with kids (this can't be happening) while walking through Paris's streets at three o'clock in the morning. Paris!You have to do something about all these homeless people, they can't go on like this!?
