So I've redone my blog for the billionst time. This time I'm actually gonna do something with it.

I'm running Octopress now and the good thing is that it is sooooo transparent.

The not so good thing is that the markup is generally a little weird, the css/sass is horrible (ids everywhere) which makes it really cumbersome to extend the thing. It's also not really clear how to do theming I think and the way the files are placed isn't nice. It would be nice to redo this more or less from scratch, and I think I'll attempt it, in either node or ruby, let's see, it'd be a nice exercise I'm sure.
