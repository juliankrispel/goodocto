When I arrived 40 minutes late at the Theatre de Varietes I was relieved: There was a huge queue outside. Great! I didn't miss anything. And I'm glad I didn't!

Quite unusually, the first talk after [Silvain Zimmer's](http://twitter.com/sylvinus "Silvain Zimmer's Twitter") introduction was fairly technical - [Mathias Bynens](http://twitter.com/mathias "Mathias Bynens Twitter") managed to entertain with what many might consider an unexciting topic: Unicode in javascript!

Mathias explains how Javascript struggles with Unicode codepoints above a certain number (He briefly covers this [here](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes#unicode)). Apparently, codepoints above a certain number have to be defined (until Ecmascript 6 comes out) by surrogate pairs like this `\uD834\uDF06` (They define the hexdecimal number of the astral codepoint when added).

I'm not entirely sure if this is chronological, but the next person on stage I remember was [Kevin Schaaf](https://twitter.com/kevinpschaaf "Kevin Schaaf's Twitter") who talked a little about [Enyo](http://enyojs.com/ "Enyo Web Application Framework"), a Web Application Framework. I haven't yet fiddled with it but as far as I know Enyo has been developed inside HP in connection with the now abandoned/open-sourced [WebOS](http://www.openwebosproject.org/ "Web OS"). 

What I can gather from Kevins talk at DotJS and from an episode about Enyo on my favourite [podcastis](http://javascriptjabber.com/ "Javascript Jabber Podcast") is that Enyo provides a high-level interface to create web-apps. Which means you hardly ever touch HTML and low-level view-logic. Worth giving this a try definately!

Next, [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani "Addy Osmani's Twitter") gave a great overview of the latest features in Chrome Developer tools (Sass debugging, live-editing/saving of files both .css and .sass and more).

When Addy's talk was cut short he went through the rest of his slides in high speed (Much to our amusement), to give the audience a sense of what they missed, apparently he had only just gotten through 20% of his presentation. Something which must have been a misunderstood between him and the organisers.

Bert Belder's talk was about technicalities of node.js. Although node intreagues me I hardly ever use it directly, hence why I couldn't take that much away from his talk, nevertheless he had an interesting face :)
